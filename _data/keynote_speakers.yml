  #  title: "Knowledge Graphs 2021: Achievements, Challenges and Opportunities"
  #  abstract: 
  #    - Machines with comprehensive knowledge of the world's entities and their relationships has been a long-standing vision and challenge of AI. Over the last two decades, huge knowledge bases, also known as knowledge graphs, have been automatically constructed from web data and text sources, and have become a key asset for search engines and other use cases. Machine knowledge can be harnessed to semantically interpret text in news, social media and web tables, contributing to  question answering, natural language processing and data analytics. This talk reviews these advances and discusses lessons learned (see <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/1900000064">http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/1900000064</a> for a comprehensive survey). Moreover, the talk identifies open challenges and new research opportunities.

  #  title: Deploying Machine Learning to help make Better Decisions
  #  abstract:
  #    - 
  #      - In August 2011, Marc Andressen wrote a prophetic article in the Wall Street
  #      - Journal, explaining how he believed industries would transform as “Software
  #      - was Eating the World.” Over the last ten years, this theme has played out as
  #      - Companies across sectors have focused on Digital Transformation. The first
  #      - iteration of Digital Transformation focused on building better experiences for
  #      - stakeholders. Bringing data together was essential for creating better
  #      - experiences, which led to deploying APIs, data lakes and other data
  #      - middleware.
  #    -
  #      - The success of Digital Transformation has resulted in data systems with
  #      - better experiences. However, having fancy dashboards and better user
  #      - experiences has not necessarily provided insights to individuals to make
  #      - better decisions. Digital Transformation 2.0 will address this and will be about
  #      - assisting stakeholders in making better decisions.
  #      - In this session, I propose to share how machine learning and artificial
  #      - intelligence can exploit the data infrastructure we have set up to help make
  #      - better decisions.
  #    -
  #      - We have created an internal data lake that collects data from different internal
  #      - data sources. In the last three years, our team at Persistent Systems has
  #      - experimented with building systems that embed machine learning and
  #      - artificial intelligence in our processes and automation to deliver precise
  #      - guidance to stakeholders to make better decisions. As we started our
  #      - experiments focusing on better decisions, we realized that the data we had
  #      - collected was not best suited to derive our insights. We also observed that
  #      - traditional business intelligence dashboards can be overwhelming and do not
  #      - necessarily provide the insights for better decisions.
  #    -
  #      - In this session, I propose sharing what we have done and what we learned
  #      - from these experiments as we embedded machine learning in our processes
  #      - and as part of our automation infrastructure. This has helped our team get
  #      - better insights precisely when needed.

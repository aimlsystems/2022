  #  title: Deploying Machine Learning to help make Better Decisions
  #  abstract:
  #    - 
  #      - In August 2011, Marc Andressen wrote a prophetic article in the Wall Street
  #      - Journal, explaining how he believed industries would transform as “Software
  #      - was Eating the World.” Over the last ten years, this theme has played out as
  #      - Companies across sectors have focused on Digital Transformation. The first
  #      - iteration of Digital Transformation focused on building better experiences for
  #      - stakeholders. Bringing data together was essential for creating better
  #      - experiences, which led to deploying APIs, data lakes and other data
  #      - middleware.
  #    -
  #      - The success of Digital Transformation has resulted in data systems with
  #      - better experiences. However, having fancy dashboards and better user
  #      - experiences has not necessarily provided insights to individuals to make
  #      - better decisions. Digital Transformation 2.0 will address this and will be about
  #      - assisting stakeholders in making better decisions.
  #      - In this session, I propose to share how machine learning and artificial
  #      - intelligence can exploit the data infrastructure we have set up to help make
  #      - better decisions.
  #    -
  #      - We have created an internal data lake that collects data from different internal
  #      - data sources. In the last three years, our team at Persistent Systems has
  #      - experimented with building systems that embed machine learning and
  #      - artificial intelligence in our processes and automation to deliver precise
  #      - guidance to stakeholders to make better decisions. As we started our
  #      - experiments focusing on better decisions, we realized that the data we had
  #      - collected was not best suited to derive our insights. We also observed that
  #      - traditional business intelligence dashboards can be overwhelming and do not
  #      - necessarily provide the insights for better decisions.
  #    -
  #      - In this session, I propose sharing what we have done and what we learned
  #      - from these experiments as we embedded machine learning in our processes
  #      - and as part of our automation infrastructure. This has helped our team get
  #      - better insights precisely when needed.

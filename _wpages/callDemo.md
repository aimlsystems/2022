### Call For Demonstration Proposals

{:.text-justify}
AIMLSystems invites submissions for software demonstration proposals. The emphasis of the demonstration program is on next-generation systems in the intersection of AI/ML and systems engineering. Proposals on prototypes that demonstrate new ideas in the following topics are highly encouraged.

* Systems for AI/ML (e.g., improvements in CPU/GPU architectures, data-intensive infrastructure, communications etc.)
* AI/ML for Systems (e.g., self-tuning databases, learning compiler optimizers, learnable network systems etc.)
* Applications of AI/ML in Socio-Economic Systems Design (e.g., public healthcare and security). 

{:.text-justify}
The evaluation criteria include the AIMLSystems audience experience and novelty of the system. In particular, the proposal should describe what the audience will see, how they can interact with the system, and user journeys that will be demonstrated.

{:.text-justify}
Demonstration proposals must not exceed 2 pages, including any appendix and bibliography. Only electronic submissions in PDF format will be considered. Page limits and formatting instructions for all remaining tracks will be announced on the conference website. Proposal reviews will follow a single-blind policy.

The manuscripts can be submitted in PDF, formatted using ACM sigconf style through [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AIMLSystems2021](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AIMLSystems2021).

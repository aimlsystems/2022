### Call For Demonstration Proposals

{:.text-justify}
The demo track of AIMLSystems invites submissions from academia and industry for live demonstrations of either prototype or production software systems that apply AI methods for solving problems, or demonstration of software systems that enable ML development and inferencing workflows. The emphasis of the demonstration program is on next-generation systems in the intersection of AI/ML and systems engineering. Proposals on prototypes that demonstrate new ideas in the following topics are highly encouraged.

1. Systems for AI/ML, including but not limited to: 
  * CPU/GPU architectures for AI/ML
  * Specialized/Embedded hardware for AI/ML workloads
  * Data intensive systems for efficient and distributed training
  * Challenges in production deployment of ML systems
  * ML programming models, languages, and abstractions,
  * ML compilers and runtime
  * Efficient systems for data preparation and processing
  * Systems for visualization of data, models, and predictions
  * Testing, debugging, and monitoring of ML applications
  * Cloud-computing for machine and deep learning
  * Machine and deep learning “as-a-service”
  * Efficient model training, optimization and inference
  * Hardware efficient ML methods
  * Resource-constrained ML
  * Tiny Machine Learning
  * Embedded and Edge Artificial Intelligence
  * Distributed and parallel learning algorithms
  * MLOps (data collection, monitoring and re-training)

2. AI/ML for Systems, including but not limited to: 
  * AI/ML for VLSI and architecture design
  * AI/ML in compiler optimization
  * AI/ML in data management - including database optimizations, virtualization, etc.
  * AI/ML for networks - design of networks, load modeling, etc.
  * AI/ML for power management - green computing, power models, etc.
  * AI/ML for Cloud Computing
  * AI/ML for IOT networks

3. AI/ML for Socio-Economic Systems Design, which includes, but not limited to: 
  * Computational design and analysis of socio-economic systems
  * Fair and bias-free systems for social welfare, business platforms
  * Applications of AI/ML in the design, short-/long-term analysis of cyber-physical systems
  * Mechanism design for socio-economic systems
  * Fairness, interpretability and explainability for ML applications
  * Privacy and security in AI/ML systems
  * Sustainability in AI/ML systems
  * Ethics in AI/ML systems
  * Applications of AI/ML in financial systems


{:.text-justify}
The evaluation criteria include the AIMLSystems audience experience and novelty of the system. In particular, the proposal should describe what the audience will see, how they can interact with the system, and user journeys that will be demonstrated.

{:.text-justify}
Demonstration proposals must not exceed 4 pages, with two pages of text describing the demonstration, and one page of appendix and bibliography. The submission must describe the technical innovation that has produced the demonstrated system. Each demo track submission should contain an introduction, brief description, screenshots, a description of the novelty of the demonstration, and the potential applications. For live demos, submissions should specify how the demonstration will be demonstrated and what the hardware requirements are (for the organisers). Authors are encouraged to add a URL to screenshots or a 2-minute youtube video showing the demo or link to an online version of the software in deployment. Only electronic submissions in PDF format will be considered. Page limits and formatting instructions for all remaining tracks will be announced on the conference website. Proposal reviews will follow a single-blind policy. 

{:.text-justify}
The manuscripts can be submitted in PDF, formatted using ACM sigconf style through [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AIMLSystems2022/](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AIMLSystems2022/Submission/Index).

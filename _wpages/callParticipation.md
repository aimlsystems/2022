<!-- ### Call for Participation -->

{:.text-justify.pe-4}
AIMLSystems is a new conference targeting research at the intersection of AI/ML 
techniques and systems engineering. Through this conference we plan to bring out and highlight 
the natural connections between these two fields and their application to socio-economic systems. 
Specifically we explore how immense strides in AI/ML techniques are made possible through 
computational systems research (e.g., improvements in CPU/GPU architectures, data-intensive infrastructure, and 
communications ), how the use of AI/ML can help in the continuous and workload-driven design space exploration 
of computational systems (e.g., self-tuning databases, learning compiler optimisers, and learnable 
network systems ), and the use of AI/ML in the design of socio-economic systems such as public healthcare, and security. 
The goal is to bring together these diverse communities and elicit connections between them.

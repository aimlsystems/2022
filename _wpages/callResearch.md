### Call for Research Papers

{:.text-justify.pe-4}
AIMLSystems is a brand new conference targeting research in the intersection of AI/ML
techniques and systems engineering. Through this conference we plan to bring out and highlight
the natural connections with these two fields. Specifically we explore how immense strides in
AI/ML techniques are made possible through computational systems research (e.g.,
improvements in CPU/GPU architectures, data-intensive infrastructure, communications etc.), 
how the use of AI/ML can help in the continuous and workload-driven design space exploration
of computational systems (e.g., self-tuning databases, learning compiler optimizers, learnable
network systems etc.) and, the use of AI/ML in the design of socio-economic systems such as
public healthcare, and security.  The goal is to bring together these diverse communities and
elicit connections between them.

#### Topics of Interest

The areas of interest are broadly categorized into the following three streams: 

1. Systems for AI/ML, including but not limited to:  
  * CPU/GPU architectures for AI/ML
  * Embedded hardware for AI/ML workloads
  * Data intensive systems for efficient and distributed training
  * Challenges in production deployment of ML systems
  * Efficient model training, optimization and inference
  * Hardware efficient ML methods
  * Resource-constrained ML
2. AI/ML for Systems, including but not limited to: 
  * AI/ML for VLSI and architecture design
  * AI/ML in compiler optimization 
  * AI/ML in data management - including database optimizations, virtualization, etc.
  * AI/ML for networks - design of networks, load modeling, etc.
  * AI/ML for power management - green computing, power models, etc.
3. Applications of AI/ML in Socio-Economic Systems Design, which includes, but not
limited to: 
  * Computational design and analysis of socio-economic systems
  * Fair and bias-free systems for social welfare, business platforms
  * Applications of AI/ML in the design, short-/long-term analysis of cyber-physical systems

#### Style and Author Instructions

Research papers must not exceed 6 pages, including any appendix, with unlimited number of pages containing only bibliography. Only electronic submissions in PDF format using the ACM sigconf template (see [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)) will be considered. <!-- The submissions will be through [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AIMLSystems2022](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AIMLSystems2022). -->

Papers can be submitted under any of the three main topics listed above. Authors are required to make a primary topic selection, with optional secondary topics for each paper. Number of papers accepted under each topic is not capped. We will accept all papers that meet the high quality and innovation levels required by the AIMLSystems conference. All papers that are accepted will appear in the proceedings. 

All accepted papers will be presented as posters at AIMLSystems 2022, but a select subset of them will be given a “conventional” (oral) presentation slot during the conference. However, all accepted papers will be treated equally in the conference proceedings, which are the persistent, archival record of the conference.

#### Ethics

* **Plagiarism Policy**: Submission of papers to AIMLSystems 2022 carries with it the implied agreement that the paper represents original work. We will follow the ACM Policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification -- see [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview). All submitted papers will be subjected to a "similarity test". Papers achieving a high similarity score will be examined and those that are deemed unacceptable will be rejected without a formal review. We also expect to report such unacceptable submissions to the superiors of each of the authors.

* Submission of papers to AIMLSystems 2022 also carries with it the implied agreement that one or more of the listed authors will register for and attend the conference and present the paper. Papers not presented at the conference will not be included in the final program or in the digital proceedings. Therefore, authors are strongly encouraged to plan accordingly before deciding to submit a paper.

#### Conflicts of Interest

During submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about Conflicts of Interest (COI) of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all (and only) PC members with potential COIs as per the definition provided on the submission site. Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.

Definition of Conflict of Interest (COI): A paper author has a COI with a PC member when and only when one or more of the following conditions hold:

* The PC member is a co-author of the paper, or has been a co-author of a paper in the last 3 years or 4 (or more) papers in the last 10 years.
* The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past two years.
* The PC member has been a collaborator within the past two years.
* The PC member is or was the author’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.
* The author is or was the PC member’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.
* The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author.


#### Review Process
All papers will be reviewed by at least 3 reviewers -- additional reviews will be sought if there is a need. Paper review will follow single-blind policy.

#### Dual Submission Policy
A paper submitted to AIMLSystems can not be under review at any other conference or journal during the entire time it is considered for review at AIMLSystems, and it must be substantially different from any previously published work or any work under review. After submission and during the review period, submissions to AIMLSystems must not be submitted to other conferences / journals for consideration. However, authors may publish at non-archival venues, such as workshops without proceedings, or as technical reports (including arXiv).

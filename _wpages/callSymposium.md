### Call For Doctoral Symposium Papers
{:.text-justify}
The Doctoral (and other Young Researcher) Symposium at AIMLSystems 2022 invites submissions from Masters/PhD students and postdoctoral fellows. This is a unique opportunity for young researchers to have fruitful peer-to-peer discussions and to get feedback from leading senior researchers about their current research work, including developing a better understanding of the problems at hand, overarching principles, the limitations of current methods, and presenting new techniques and algorithms.

#### Guidelines for Abstract Submission:

{:.text-justify}
We invite applicants to submit a 2-page extended abstract compiling your research towards your dissertation in a coherent manner. We welcome papers describing published novel research, work-in-progress, and comparison of existing methods and tools (e.g., lessons learned). We recommend that the abstract highlights the following about your research:

* Motivation 
* Major contributions of the thesis
* Key challenges identified or addressed
* Modeling challenges when deployed as systems for use
* Empirical and/or qualitative discussion of results
* Timeline and roadmap for thesis plan (may include some projects that are in future plans)

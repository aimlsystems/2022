### Call For Tutorials
{:.text-justify}
AI-ML Systems is a new conference targeting the research in the intersection of Systems Engineering and Artificial Intelligence - Machine Learning techniques. We invite original tutorial contributions in all aspects of this including but not limited to: advances in computational systems, AI/ML advances based on computational systems, AI/ML based socio-techno-economic systems

#### Description:

{:.text-justify}
We are excited to launch the call for proposals for tutorials at the AI-ML Systems 2022 conference that will continue to bring awareness and push the envelope in areas of interaction between computational systems and AI/ML advances.

A tutorial submission may fall into one of the following categories:

* Lecture-style Tutorial
* Hands-on Tutorial

{:.text-justify}
All tutorials will be part of the main conference technical program, and are available free of charge to the attendees of the conference.

##### Lecture-style tutorial

{:.text-justify}
A lecture-style tutorial will cover the state-of-the-art research, development and applications in a specific area of computational systems, AI/ML research, socio- techno-economic systems or interactions of these. The aim from this would be to stimulate and facilitate future work.

Tutorials on interdisciplinary directions, bridging scientific research and applied communities, novel and fast growing directions, and significant applications are highly encouraged.

Lecture-style tutorials will be 3 hours in duration.

##### Hands-on tutorial

{:.text-justify}
A hands-on tutorial will feature in-depth hands-on training on cutting edge systems and tools of relevance to the community at the intersection of computational systems and AI/ML.

These sessions are targeted at novice as well as moderately skilled users. The focus should be on providing hands-on experience to the attendees. The pace of the tutorial should be set such that beginners can follow along comfortably. The tools &amp; systems must have a proven track record of success in the community.

Tutorials should introduce the motivation behind the tool, the associated fundamental concepts and work through examples, and demonstrate its application to relatable real-life use cases.

Hands-on tutorials will also be 3 hours in duration.

#### Proposal

{:.text-justify}
We invite proposals from researchers, creators, experienced practitioners and tutors of data mining systems and tools. Each proposal must include the following details:

* A descriptive title
* Abstract (300 words)
* Target audience and prerequisites for the tutorial (e.g. audience expertise)
* Tutors (name, affiliation, email, address, phone)
* Tutors’ short bio and expertise related to the tutorial (up to 200 words per
tutor)
	* List of in-person presenters, i.e., tutors who will attend AI-ML Systems, and present part of the tutorial
	* List of contributors, i.e., tutors who will only help prepare the tutorial material
* Corresponding tutor with her/his email address
* Tutorial outline. Please provide as much detail as possible.
* If the tutorial or a similar/highly related tutorial has been presented before (either by the same author(s) or by others): A list of forums, their event dates and locations, the number of participants.
* A list of up to 30 most important references that will be covered in the tutorial
* A brief discussion of the potential societal impacts of your tutorial
* Indicate style: Lecture style/hands-on style.


#### Submissions

{:.text-justify}
Authors should submit a short summary of the tutorial to be included in the conference proceedings. The summary (maximum 2 pages) should include tutorial title, abstract, and presenters’ biography.

Template guidelines are here: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template

For tutorial materials/website, the tutorial should be made available as a Github page with the following details:
* Presenters’ names and bibliography
* Tutorial outline
* What will the participants learn from the tutorial.


Submission site: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AIMLSystems2022/](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AIMLSystems2022/ ).

#### Attendance

{:.text-justify}
For each accepted tutorial, at least one author must register, attend the conference and present the tutorial. Authors of all accepted tutorials must prepare a summary to be included in the conference proceedings and deliver the
tutorial at the conference.


#### Key Dates

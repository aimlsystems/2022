# Visa Request Process for AI-ML SYSTEMS

{:.text-justify.pe-4}
Over the past several years the obtaining of a visa has become more complex requiring more attention, energy and time. Additionally, embassies have different requirements. Some may request:
<div markdown=1 class="bd-callout bd-callout-info alert-dark">
1. A letter from AI-ML SYSTEMS verifying intentions of conference participant
2. Confirmation that the paper was accepted
3. A receipt that conference fees have been paid in full
4. Appearance or interview by conference participant
</div>
{:.text-justify.pe-4}
As a result of these requirements by some embassies, AI-ML SYSTEMS encourages attendees to apply no later than 3 (three) months prior the conference. Letters of "Invitation" will be issued to:
<div markdown=1 class="bd-callout bd-callout-info alert-dark">

3. People professionally or personally known by a committee member
